        <div class="div-center">
            <div class="content">
                <p>If you are thinking of building or renovating, you need to check if the work is classed as
                    ‘Restricted Building Work’ (RBW). If it is, you will require a licensed building practitioner – or
                    LBP – to do it.
                </p>
                <p>Because this work is so important, it is only allowed to be carried out by a Licensed Building
                    Practitioner (LBP). LBPs are assessed before obtaining a license, and they have to maintain their
                    skills to keep their licence.</p>
                <p>Building a new home is one of the biggest commitments you will ever make – so it pays to get it right
                    the first time. </p>
